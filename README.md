# Todo Web App

> Feel free to use this yourself, although it's WIP, so I wouldn't recommend it

## Introduction

This is just a **small project**, which I might use some day haha!

## Requirements

A [Go compiler](https://go.dev/dl/) is **required** to run this program.

## Getting Started

Start the webserver running the `go run main.go` command in the same directory as the main.go file.
